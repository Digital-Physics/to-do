This is code for a simple website that allows the user to save a To Do list. The To Do items are saved even when the page is refreshed or closed and then reopened (if the user uses the same browser) using localStorage. No sign-in is needed from the end user. No databases were implemented, although your browser implements Local Storage under the hood somehow for storing and retrieving key-value pairs.

You can see the To Do app deployed here:

Feel free to use it yourself :)
